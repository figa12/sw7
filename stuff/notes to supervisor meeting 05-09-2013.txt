Supervisor meeting with Hua Lu
First meeting
Date: 05-09-2013
all group members are here

Idea exhibitions System:
app on android phone
shows map of exhibitions and can guide the user around the exhibitions with route maps.
The app should also show live updates given by the booths at the exhibitions.
The app should not be bound to a single exhibitions, the user should be able to supscribe to different exhibitions to be able to recieve the updates.
The app should also show a schedule of the exhibitions.


Meeting:
Henrik tells Hua Lu the idea.

It is a very good start, the focus is clear..
He thinks though that the whole idea could be bigger, although he thinks it is solid if we succed with every part in the idea.

Henrik explains that it can easily be expanded to theme parks, if it is succesfull.

Hua Lu:
We should write a description part to help us make the idea is clear. Prototype is app on tablet.
Hua Lu like that we focus on the route planner.
Hua Lu suggest QR codes instead of NFC chips. jesper comes with the argument that a QR can be scanned from a far distance.(Hua lu like this argument)

Hua Lu suggest infrequent meeting from the start(for the next meeting we are going to have a basic description of the idea. We are going to mail Hua Lu when we need a meeting... 2 weeks maybe?)

the app should be flexible to different exhibitions

Write two days before(and deliver the reading material), have a agenda ready at the meeting.

Everybody should have a good understanding about this project.
