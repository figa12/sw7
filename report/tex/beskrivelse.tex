The basic idea is to map an exhibition and collect data from people's locations and interests. Furthermore the mobile application should aid the users to get more information from the exhibition.


\textbf{Features}

Application to load floorplan and make routes. (Administration).

Administration website

\textit{A place to insert information and location of booths.}

\textbf{Mobile application}

NFC tag reader

Should read a "global" tag that binds the application to the current exhibition.

Should also read a "local" tag that is bound to each booth.

\textit{This could trigger additional information about the booth, or help you get directions to anohter booth.}

Time schedule of events.

View floorplan.

A feed of realtime news. A booth could for example send a realtime post to all users interested in this booth.

\textit{Twitter could be incorporated in this.}

When the application is not bound to anything, the app should show an exhibition browser that lets you search for exhibitions that you might be interested in.

\textbf{Ideas of ways to subscribe to booths}

Every booth have some categories, and when the initial NFC is read, you can choose which categories you wish to subscribe to.

Every booth is subscribed to from start, and the user must manually unsubscribe from everything he finds uninteresting.

\textbf{Information that could be gathered from the users/mobile app}

Density / queues ( This could be shown to the users, realtime)

General interests

Statistics of each booth

\textit{When a user scans a tag at a booth, the hit should be recorded. An idea is that he chooses to either get more information or get directions to another booth. Data from both can be gathered.}\citep{rtsbog}
