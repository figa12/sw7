The purpose of the website is to allow the exhibition managers to make a floorplan, feeds, schedule and other concepts of an exhibition.
It is designed as a (almost) one-page site. 

The website is build using HTML, PHP and jQuery. The main tab on the website is the map-tab. This tab is build using Google Maps API. Using this tab the user can create a compelte exhibition from the ground up.
After creating an exhibition, with booths, a floorplan and companies. The user can add feeds to the exhibition, using the Feeds tab. A schedule can be added using the the schedule tab.
It is also possible to load an existing exhibtion from the database, for th loaded exhibition the floorplan will be shown but the user is unable to edit the floorplan in the current version.

The website uses the ajax technology for form submit to make the website more userfriendly. The ajax posts to PHP, which handles the database interaction. When connection to the database we are using prepare statements, to make sure no malicious data is inserted into the database.

The design of the website is done using Twitter Bootstrap making it more slick, and uniform.
The main focus in the website is functionallity and therefore the design and usability is not the main priorty.
