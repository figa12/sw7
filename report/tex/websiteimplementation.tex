The purpose of the website is to allow the exhibition managers to make a floorplan, feeds and a schedule for the exhibition.
It should also in the future be able to edit the floorplan for any given exhibition.
The website is ment as a one-page application based upon google maps, and jquery forms.
It is possible, with easy navigation to get around to the diffrent concepts of the exhibtion.

The techologies of the website includes google maps to make a floor plan. Creating both booths and a road, as well as binding entrypoints for the booths. The site relays on jquery when creating the diffrent concepts.
We also have php on the website, it is this which stands for the communication between the website and the database.
In the php part, we use prepare statements to make sure no data can be injected.

Also explain something about how it is build. The diffrent load things, ajax and all that good stuff.
