The development process for this project has its offspring in the agile methodology. 

During the first week of the project we brainstormed our ideas and figured out which direction we wanted with the application. We presented our idea for our supervisor and we were ready to start developing. We started researching the design of other applications, to get inspiration for our own.
This research resulted in prototypes for each activity in our application. After the initial design prototypes were made, we started coding our application.
Throughout the coding phase of the project, we making use of pair programming and refactoring.

All documentation of the application was done after the coding phase ended. This made it easier for us to document it, because we knew there no more changes would be introduced. This meant we only had to write our documentation one time, instead of updating it after each time the code was updated.
