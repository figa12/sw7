The development process for this project has its off-spring in the agile methodology. 

During the first week of the project we brainstormed our ideas and figured out which road we wanted to take our application. We presented our idea for our supervisor and we were ready to start developing. We started researching the design of other applications, to get inspiration for our own, this resulted in prototypes for each activity in our application. After the initial design prototypes were made, we started coding our application. Throughout the coding phase, this was all we focused on, making use of pair programming and re-factoring. 

All documentation of the application was done in the end of the developing phase, after the application was finished. This made it easier for us to document in the end because we knew there would not come any changes to the application which would be needed to be changed in the documentation too.
