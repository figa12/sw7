\section{Black-box testing}
We have created some black-box test cases for our Android application. We are performing the tests ourselves, we do this in order to test that all the different functionality requirements are working and producing correct results.

All test cases are presented in the form of a case header consisting of the case name, objective of the test, preconditions for the test, and the requirement we are satisfying. After the header we have made a procedure describing the steps that should be performed in the case and for each step we have a success criteria describing the expected outcome of the step.

\subsection*{Case results}
\begin{description}
\item[\casetwo] This test was a success. The application does not stall and it loads the old feeds, until there are no more feeds to load
\item[\casethree] This test was a success. When having a feed open and scanning an \ac{nfc} tag, it snaps to the booth as intended.
\item[\casefour] This test was a success. When a booth creates a new feed, the button shows up and allows the user to manually load the new feed
\item[\casefive] This test was a success. When subscribing or unsubscribing to booths, their feeds are added and removed accordingly 
\item[\casesix] This test was a success. The first time the \ac{nfc} tag was scanned the application opened and we had to choose which booths to subscribe to, and after closing and opening the application again it opens up directly in the tab activity without having to choose categories
\item[\caseseven] This test was a success. When scanning an \ac{nfc} tag with a boothID the "Map" tab opened and snapped to the booth on the floor plan
\item[\caseeight] This test was a success. When clicking the booth the information box comes up and if  you press the "Navigate to" button a route is drawn from your last known location and to the booth
\item[\casenine] This test resulted in success. When scanning a different \ac{nfc} tag the user is signed out and signed in at the new exhibition, getting prompted to choose categories again.
