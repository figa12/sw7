\subsection*{Description of The Idea.}
Our idea is to make the visit to an exhibition more informative and personalised. \todo{britisk} With a mobile application the visitor should be able to get a personalised \todo{britisk} route around the exhibition. The visitor can also get additional information about a booth by scanning a tag placed at the booth, When scanning a tag some text will appear on the mobile application which provides the visitor with more information. The mobile application should also provide a schedule for events happening around the exhibition. A live feed will also be available for the visitor, the live feed will provide the visitor with information about small events at the booths like giveaways, contest, etc. The feeds will be published by the booths, and should give the booths a place where they can make themselves attractable for the visitors.
