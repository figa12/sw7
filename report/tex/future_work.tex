\item[Exhibition statistics] Right now we save how many times each user has visited a booth, i.e. each time they scan an \ac{nfc} tag at a booth. All the statistics can be shown to the exhibition organisers.

Metrics could be: How many subscribers each booth has, how many times navigation to a booth has been requested, and how many users an exhibition has.
\item[User recommendations] Based on the users subscriptions and which booths the user has visited, we could recommend other booths to the user.
\item[Tag scanned event] When an \ac{nfc} tag is scanned we could provide the user with different actions, such as: Navigate from this booth to another, subscribe/unsubscribe from booth, or you could show the booth on map.
