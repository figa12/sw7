%\item[Other map items] We only show booths and paths on the map. It is not possible to show a stage or a 'you are here' stand. There is a workaround for this at the moment, you can create a booth instead, but it might confuse the exhibition organisers.
\item[Exhibition schedule] The exhibition organisers can not create a schedule bound to the exhibition, you can only create a schedule for a booth.% This is also part of the lack of functionality mentioned above.
\item[Exhibition statistics] Right now we save how many times each user has visited a booth, i.e. each time they scan an \ac{nfc} tag at a booth. All the statistics should be shown to the exhibition organisers.

Metrics could be: How many subscribers each booth has, how many times navigation to a booth has been requested, and how many users an exhibition has.
\item[User recommendations] Based on the users subscriptions and which booths the user has visited, we could recommend other booths which belongs to the same category.
\item[Tag scanned event] When an \ac{nfc} tag is scanned we could provide the user with different actions, such as: Navigate from this booth to another, subscribe/unsubscribe from booth, or you could show the booth on floor plan.
\item[Website login system] On the website a login system could be implemented, so make sure exhibition managers can only manage their own exhibitions. It should also provide the option for individual booth managers to login, creating both feeds and schedule for the booths they manage.
\item[Automatic \ac{nfc} creation] From the website, when finishing creating an exhibition, an list should be provided to the user, containing all information for the \ac{nfc} tags of the exhibition. This list could then be sent to a supplier, and the user would receive pre made \ac{nfc} tags.
\item[Automatic tile creation] From the website, the user should have the possibility to upload a single picture floor plan, and from this picture the server would create tiles for the floor plan to use. This would cut out the need for the developers to create the tiles.
