\chapter{Server communication}
This chapter describes the communication between server and client, as well as the design choices and implementation of database. \todo{Bør database være et kapitel for sig selv?}

\section{Database}
We are using a MySQL database with the MyISAM storage engine and which is located at a remote server. \todo{info om hvor osv.?}

The server contains all data about each exhibition, the companies at the exhibition, the booths at the exhibitions, the feeds each booth provides, the schedule, and some basic information about the users.
