\section*{Problem statement}

The number of people with smartphones is steadily growing each year,\todo{Kilde} which means more and more have access to the internet outside their homes.

This opens up for a whole range of possibilities for taking advantage of the ease of access to the Internet. For example providing the user with relevant information based on where the user is. 

It could be that the user is at an exhibition but it is too hard to get a overview of which booths have relevance for them, then he could choose what interested him and he could help finding these booths. It could also be that the user was at a theme park and he could get directions to roller coasters that interests him, or live updates on queue lines. The user could also be at a museum and receive information about the paintings he was looking at.  

In the project we focus on exhibitions, because we feel that has the most relevance to us. Instead of just making a tool which allows the users the receive relevant information about the exhibition, we also want it to easier for the people behind the exhibitions to set up an exhibition by creating some sort of simple administrator tool.

We came up with following statement for our goal for this project
