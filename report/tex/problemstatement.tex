\section{Problem statement}\label{sec:problemstatement}

The number of people with smartphones is steadily growing each year\citep{smartphonenumber}, which means an increasing number of people have access to the internet outside their homes.

This opens up for a whole range of possibilities for taking advantage of the ease of access to the Internet. For example, providing the user with relevant information based on the user's location. 

It could be that the user is at an exhibition but it is too hard to get an overview of which booths have relevance for him, he could then choose what interests him and he could get help finding these booths. It could also be that the user was at a theme park and he could get directions to roller coasters that interests him, live updates on queue lines or help locating the food stores.

In this project we focus on exhibitions. Instead of just making a tool that allow the users to receive relevant information about the exhibition, we also want it to be easier for the organisers to set up an exhibition by creating a simple administration tool.

We came up with the following statement for our goal for this project:

How can we ease the creation of exhibitions, while enhancing the user's experience by providing them with relevant information while at the exhibition.
